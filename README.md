# Pluriboom 16mm Battery Packs
Battery pack designs with replaceable cells for use with 16mm cameras


## Problem
Many 16mm cameras rely on battery packs that are no longer available or are prohibitively expensive. Often times these packs will just die over time and then become trash. To that end I decided to design a new pack which could utilize replaceable cells, and be built for an affordable price. **This pack does not charge batteries!**

## Solution
In this repository you will find the STL files needed to 3d print your own 16mm camera battery packs. 

My first iteration was a design specific to the Arri 16s camera - to utilize **NIMH AA battery cells** - which I use for quite a few other devices - and since I am not always shooting 16mm film, would love to share between my different devices. You can find those under the Arri 16s directory. This pack uses 7 x AA Batteries. 

The second iteration was a more universal pack - this utilized **button top protected 18650 lithium-ion cells** -  this pack is more complex as it involves a voltage regulator, a power button and a voltmeter. This pack can be used with any number of cameras that utilize a 4-pin xlr connector - as long as they draw 5 amps or less. 

## Parts
To build one of these battery packs - you will need a few supplies - I will list those below. I will generally list part numbers and only list links if they are to stable vendors like Mouser or Digi-Key.
